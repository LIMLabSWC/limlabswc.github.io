    title: "New female rat brain atlases from SWC Neuroinformatics unit and LIM Lab"
    paragraphs:
      - >-
        We're excited to announce the release of two rat brain atlases
        generated by the [SWC Neuroinformatics unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/index.html)
        and **LIM Lab**, now available through the BrainGlobe ecosystem.
        They provide two-photon microscopy–based 3D templates from juvenile
        female animals, addressing gaps in resolution and biological
        diversity in existing rat atlases.

    title: "ERC Consolidator Grant Awarded"
    paragraphs:
      - >-
        We are thrilled to announce that Dr. Athena Akrami has been awarded
        a Consolidator Grant by the European Research Council (ERC) to
        investigate statistical learning in rats, mice, and humans.
      - >-
        The award of €2 million over five years will enable us to continue
        to pursue our long-term research endeavours on statistical learning
        and its interaction with working memory. The funding will allow the
        recruitment of postdoctoral fellows as well as research technicians
        for up to five years.
      - >-
        This is a significant milestone for our lab and will greatly enhance
        our research capabilities in understanding the neural mechanisms
        underlying learning and memory.
