        <h3>ERC Consolidator Grant Awarded</h3>
        <p>We are thrilled to announce that Dr. Athena Akrami has been awarded a Consolidator Grant by the European Research Council (ERC) to investigate statistical learning in rats, mice, and humans.</p>
        <p>The award of â‚¬2 million over five years will enable us to continue to pursue our long-term research endeavours on statistical learning and its interaction with working memory. The funding will allow the recruitment of postdoctoral fellows as well as research technicians for up to five years.</p>
        <p>This is a significant milestone for our lab and will greatly enhance our research capabilities in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory.</p>
