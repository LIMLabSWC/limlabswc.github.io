      <p>Finding and exploiting patterns and regularities in the environment is a critical brain function. We infer statistical patterns and regularities from sensory input, and these priors are formed through experience and learning.</p>
      
      <p>The link between past, present, and future memories is crucial for organizing sensory memory and integrating learned priors with current sensory input to make predictions about the future.</p>
      <p>At LIM Lab, we use theory, experiment, high-throughput training, behavioral paradigms, and tools to monitor neural circuits to understand how the brain learns, remembers, and makes inferences.</p>
